## 🎯 Attack Types in Detail

### 1. **Flooding Attack**
```
Type: DoS (Denial of Service)
Description: Overwhelming the CAN bus with high-frequency messages
Impact: Prevents legitimate messages from being transmitted
Test File: test_flooding.csv
```

### 2. **Suppress Attack**
```
Type: Message Suppression
Description: Preventing specific CAN messages from being transmitted
Impact: ECUs don't receive critical signals
Test File: test_suppress.csv
```

### 3. **Plateau Attack**
```
Type: Signal Manipulation
Description: Forcing signal values to remain constant
Impact: Sensors appear frozen, incorrect vehicle state
Test File: test_plateau.csv
```

### 4. **Continuous Attack**
```
Type: Continuous Injection
Description: Continuously injecting malicious CAN messages
Impact: False sensor readings, incorrect control commands
Test File: test_continuous.csv
```

### 5. **Playback Attack**
```
Type: Replay Attack
Description: Recording and replaying legitimate CAN messages
Impact: Duplicate actions, unauthorized commands
Test File: test_playback.csv
```

## 🔄 Data Preprocessing

### Steps Applied:
1. **Loading**: Read CSV files with CAN messages
2. **Forward Filling**: Fill missing values
3. **Scaling**: Min-Max normalization using pre-computed scaler
4. **Windowing**: Create time series windows (50 time steps)
5. **Reshaping**: Convert to image-like format (50×20×1)

### Scaler Information
```
Location: scaler/min_max_values_syncan.csv
Type: Min-Max Scaler
Purpose: Normalize signal values to [0, 1]
Pre-computed: Yes (from training data)
